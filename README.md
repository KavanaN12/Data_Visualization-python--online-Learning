# 📊 Online Learning Experience Visualization

Welcome to the **Online Learning Data Visualization** project! 🎓
This project explores students' experiences with emergency remote teaching (ERT) and online learning through intuitive and informative visualizations built with Python.

---

## 🚀 Overview

In response to the shift toward remote learning, this project uses survey data to uncover trends and insights on:

* 💻 **Devices Used**
* 🛠️ **Platforms Utilized**
* ⚠️ **Challenges Faced**
* ⏱️ **Time Spent**
* 🌟 **Satisfaction & Preferences**

It also simulates performance data to compare learning outcomes between **Face-to-Face (FTF)** and **Online** formats.

## 📂 Project Structure

### 📁 `data/`

* `ERT-Spreadsheet-01.xlsx` – Primary survey dataset.

### 📄 `visualization_script.py`

* Cleans and processes the data.
* Generates various plots to highlight findings.

| **Platform Usage**            | Tools like Zoom, Google Meet, Moodle visualized in a ranked bar chart.   |
| **Challenges Word Cloud**     | Visual flair showing student struggles (e.g., motivation, connectivity). |
| **Satisfaction Histogram**    | Distribution of support ratings from institutions.                       |
| **Benefits Pie Chart**        | Percentage of students who saw value in online learning.                 |
| **Learning Preference**       | Post-pandemic learning preference bar chart.                             |
| **FTF vs Online Performance** | Scatter & bar plots comparing student performance.                       |
| **Preference Pie Chart**      | Visualizes preferred learning mode (FTF vs Online).                      |
